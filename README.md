- lab3-0
- lab3-1
- lab4
- lab8-0
- lab9

These are my labs for programming lessons in Novosibirsk State University
Ill be trying to complete them as i have enough time to do it.
Not all of these labs in repo are completed yet.
This source code is done only for learning aims and controlling my progress. Nothing more.

P.S. * means that lab passes **all of the tests and gives correct results for _testers_** (they are located in test folders for every lab and executables for macos in TestsForMac directory)
