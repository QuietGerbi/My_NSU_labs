These are my labs for programming lessons in Novosibirsk State University
Ill be trying to complete them as i have enough time to do it.
Not all of these labs in repo are completed yet.
This source code is done only for learning aims and controlling my progress. Nothing more.
Also these programms are **_modified_** and have some additional functions not just to pass all of the tests.

P.S. * means that lab passes **all of the tests and gives correct results for _testers_** (they are located in test folder for each lab. Executables for macos are located in TestsForMac directory)
